# openai_php
Connect a PHP project to the OpenAI API without any packages

I wanted to use OpenAI's API in a lightweight project using as few packages as possible.
This does that with no dependencies.

## Set up
- Set up a simple (and i mean very simple) config file with your API key
- Adapt index.php as needed
